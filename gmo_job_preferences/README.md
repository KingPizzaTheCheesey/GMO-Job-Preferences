# GMO Job Preferences

The goal of this mod is to add a new way for pops to automatically choose jobs. There will be a few traits that can be selected that will give large weights to certain jobs. All jobs will also be rebalanced so pops will move to open jobs more quickly. If possible, I will also add a hapiness bonus to pops who are working a job that matches there preference. 

## Stage 1

- Add new traits to boost job preference. I am opting to use a few traits as general categories that include jobs at different levels.
  - Worker 
    - miner +
    - crystal_miner/gas_extractor/mote_harvester ++
    - foundry ++
    - gas_refiner/chemist/translucer ++
    - gas_plant_engineer ++++
    - odd_factory_worker ++++
  - Intellectual 
    - technician +
    - bluelotus_technician ++++
    - researcher ++
    - head_researcher +++
    - dimensional_portal_researcher ++++
  - Spiritualist
    - preacher +
    - healthcare ++
    - priest ++
    - death_chronicler ++
    - high_priest +++
    - telepath +++
  - Administrator
    - colonist ++
    - bureaucrat ++
    - administrator +++
    - executive +++
  - Entertainer
    - clerk +
    - entertainer ++
    - artisan ++
    - noble +++
  - Military Specialist 
    - soldier +
    - enforcer ++
    - duelist ++
- Begin prototyping a new low-income system.

## Stage 2

- Make job preferences random at first (based on current job), with boosts to having a preference
- Add happiness modifier for pops working jobs that match their preference

## Stage 3

- Expirement with different buffs and penalities for job preference
  - resource output
  - upkeep cost
- Finalize low-income system

## Way of Life Mod
- Lots of buffs/penalities for playing into/against people's way of life
- New policy or edict that makes pops much more likely to move to jobs where resources are needed the most
  - Comes with worker and specialist happiness penalty (job instability)
- Add modifiers to egaltarian and authoritarian beliefs
  - Egaltarian pops are more likely to take jobs that match their preference
  - Authoritarian pops do not care 
- Acension perk
  - Pops won't take jobs that are against their way of life
  - Pop consumer goods upkeep modifier
  - All jobs upkeep modifier
- 'Happy to Serve' trait
  - Moderate boost for being employed in any job
  - Small penalty for being unemployed
  - Possibly locked behind acension perk
  - 3 levels:
    - Happy to Help
    - Ready to Serve
    - At Your Disposal
  - Would balance mod for authoritarian play
- Natural Leader trait
  - Compatible with other way of life traits
  - Gives small planet-wide buff to current job
-
